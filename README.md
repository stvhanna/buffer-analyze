## Quick Start

1. Run `yarn` in order to install all dependencies.
2. Run `yarn run watch` in order to use Webpack dev server to watch for file changes and rebundle on the fly (and trigger HMR!).
3. Enjoy âœ¨

## NPM Commands

### bootstrap

This runs `npm` install on each package and symlinks local packages.

### clean

Deletes all `node_modules` from all packages. Use this first if you see any odd dependency errors and then follow with `npm run bootstrap`;

### test

Runs `npm test` on all packages

### init

Runs `npm install` on the top level package and then runs `npm run bootstrap` to setup all packages.

### start

Start up the analyze service (dev mode starts up webpack with hot module reloading).

### publish

**Coming Soon** This publishes the packages on NPM

### build

**Coming Soon** Use webpack to create a production build

## Adding New Dependencies

Adding packages to a `lerna` projects is slightly different than adding to a standard node package. Common `devDependencies` can be added to the top level `package.json` file. For more details on that: https://github.com/lerna/lerna#common-devdependencies

### Adding A Common Dependencies

This is the most likely scenario you'll face.

in the root directory (`buffer-analyze/`) run the following commands:

```sh
npm run -SDE some-cool-package
npm run bootstrap
```

This makes `some-cool-package` available to all packages

### Creating A Dependency To Another Local Package

To create a dependency to the shared-components package from the a package:

In the `foo` package add the following entry in the `packages/foo/package.json` file under the dependencies key:

```js
{
  //...other stuff...
  dependencies:{
    //...other dependencies...
    "@bufferapp/shared-components": "0.0.1", // this version must be exact otherwise it fetches from npm
  }
}
```

**Important**

The version number must be exact to link local packages, otherwise it will (try to) fetch the package from NPM.


### Add A Dependency That Runs A Binary

An example of this would be `eslint` or `jest`. These should be added to the individual package:

```sh
cd packages/foo/
npm run -SDE jest
```

## How Packages Communicate

At a high level each package communicates using the [Observer Pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern) through the Redux store. This means that each package receives all events and decides whether to modify their own state or ignore the event. An event (or action) flows from the originator to all other packages (including itself):


```
Package-A ---action--->Redux Store--->Package-B
  ^                             |
  |-----------------------------|---->Package-C
```

If you need to listen to another packages events, import the actionTypes into the package you're building:


```js
// handle login event
export default (state, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'APP_INIT':
      return {
        ...state,
        initialized: true,
      };
    default:
      return state;
  }
};
```
